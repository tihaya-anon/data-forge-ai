# DataForge AI - AI Assistant Rules

# Project Type
type: portfolio-demo
language: mixed (Python, Java/Scala, YAML, Markdown, D2)
purpose: Job-seeking demonstration of big data + AI/LLM skills

# Core Technologies
- Apache Kafka (messaging)
- Apache Flink (stream processing)
- Apache Spark (batch processing)
- Apache Paimon (data lake)
- Milvus (vector database)
- Elasticsearch (full-text search)
- Redis (cache)
- Apache Doris (OLAP)
- Apache Airflow (orchestration)
- D2 (diagrams as code)

# Code Style

## Makefile
- Use `printf` instead of `echo` for ANSI colors
- Add `## description` comment for help auto-generation
- Colors: $(GREEN), $(YELLOW), $(CYAN), $(RED), $(NC)
- Modular structure with `include makefiles/*.mk`

## Docker Compose
- NO cross-file YAML anchors (they don't work)
- Each compose file must be self-contained
- Network: `dataforge` (external)
- Container naming: `dataforge-<service>`
- Always include healthcheck for services

## D2 Diagrams
- Theme: 200
- Layout: elk
- Pad: 20
- NO external icon URLs (use emoji or text labels)
- NO `near: right` (invalid, use top-center/bottom-center)
- Use `|md ... |` carefully - no special chars after closing `|`

# File Organization
- `/Makefile` - main entry point
- `/makefiles/*.mk` - modular make targets
- `/docker/compose.*.yml` - modular docker services
- `/docs/diagrams/*.d2` - diagram sources
- `/docs/images/*.svg` - generated (gitignored)
- `/docs/*.md` - documentation

# Important Notes
1. SVG files are NOT committed - generated by GitHub Actions
2. This is a DEMO project, not production code
3. Focus on architecture demonstration, not implementation details
4. All Chinese comments are acceptable (target audience includes Chinese speakers)
